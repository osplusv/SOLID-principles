# SOLID Principles

This project contains examples describing non-reusable code with:

- **Rigidity**: When a change to one part of a program can break another part
- **Fragility**: When things break in unrelated places
- **Immobility**: When code cannot be reused outside its original context

And its respective solution using SOLID principles:

- **SRP** — Single Responsibility Principle
- **OCP** — Open/Close Principle
- **LSP** — Liskov Substitution Principle
- **IPS** — Interface Segregation Principle
- **DIP** — Dependency Inversion Principle

Examples are taken from the book _The Object-Oriented Thought Process, 5th Edition by Matt Weisfeld._
